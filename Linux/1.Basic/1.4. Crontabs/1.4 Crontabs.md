  
The Cron daemon is a long-running process that executes commands at specific dates and times. It can schedule activities as one-time events or recurring tasks. A crontab file dontains commands and instructions for the Cron to execute.  
  
To see what Cronjobs are active run:  
  
 cat /etc/crontab  
   
This command should be run manually when there's a chance, especially when i.e. [LinEnum](Hacking--4._Maintaining_access--4.1_Enumeration--4.1.1_LinEnum.html) doesn't find anything.  
  
Crontab is made in special format:
