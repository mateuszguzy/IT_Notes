  
Webshell is a term to describe a script that runs inside a webserver, usually in PHP or ASP code, and executes code on the server.  
  
Commands are entered into a webpage either through a HTML form or directly as arguments in the URL. Then they are executed by the script with the result returned and written to the page.  
  
As example let's take PHP and basic one-liner  
  
`<?php echo "<pre>" . shell\_exec($\_GET["cmd"]) . "</pre>"; ?>`  
  
It takes GET parameter i th URL and execute it on the system with **shell\_exec()**. That means that any command we enter in the URL after **?cmd=** will be executed on the system. The **“pre”** elements are to ensure that the results are formatted in correct way.
