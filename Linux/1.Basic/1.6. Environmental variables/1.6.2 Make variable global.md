  
When creating a local variable it can only be used in current bash session.   
  
Local variable syntax:  
  
 <name>=<value>  
  
After close it will be deleted. To make it global an export is needed.  
  
 export <variable name>  
   
But it's not saved yet, so after terminal window close it will also be deleted. To make persistent variable it must be written in “ **.bashrc** ” file.

All changes in writing persistent variable require terminal restart.
