  
**nmap -sS** - also refered as "half-open" or "stealth" scan. When TCP scan perform a full three-way handshake, SYN scan sends back a RST TCP packet after receiving a SYN/ACK from the server (it prevents server from trying to make the request)

Advantages:  
• can bypass older Intrusion Detection which are looking for a full three-way handshake. But it's often no longer the case with modern IDS solutions.   
• SYN scans are not logged by applications listening to open ports, because standard is to log connections which are fully established  
• because of no need to completing connection or disconnecting, SYN scans are signigicanlty faster than TCP Connect scan.  
  
  
Cons:  
◇ require sudo permission, in order to work correctly. It's because SYN scans require the ability to create RAW packets,  
◇ unstable services are sometimes brought down by SYN scans which could be problematic
