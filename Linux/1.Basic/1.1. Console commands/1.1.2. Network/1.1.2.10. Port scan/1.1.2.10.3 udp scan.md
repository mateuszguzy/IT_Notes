Which means that it can be open of behind firewall. Rarely there is a response from UDP port then port is just marked as open.   
  
When request is send to closed port, then response is ICMP (ping) packet containing mesage that the port is unreachable.  
  
Because it's difficult to identify whether UDP port is actually open UDP scans take much longer than TCP (about 20min to scan first 1000 ports). That's why good practise is to run nmap scan with --top-ports <number> flag, which provides number of most used ports to scan.
