  
All three are interlinked and used primarly because they tend to be even more stealthier than SYN scan.  
• **nmap -sN** - NULL scan, request is send with no flags at all expect RST for closed port  
• **nmap - sF** - FIN, request contains FIN flag, expect RST for closed port  
• **nmap -sX** - Xmas, sends a malformed TCP packet, and expects RST response for closed ports  
  
  
All above expect the same server response and are very similiar to UDP scan. Because of it, ports are only identified as open|filtered, closed or filtered.  
  
Tho RFC 793 says that network hosts respond to malformed packet shoul be a RST TCP packet, that in reality it's not always like that. Windows OS, and CISCO devices ane known to response with a RST to any malformed TCP packet regardless of whether the porst is actually open or not. This results in all ports shown as closed.  
  
Main goal of above scans it to **evade firewalls**. Many firewalls are configured to drop incoming TCP packet to blocked ports which have SYN flag set. FULL, FIN and Xmas scans do not contain SYN flag. It may seem as good technique but most of common**IDS**'s (**Intrusion Detection System**), exclude this type of scan.
