Default Windows firewall will block all ICMP packets. It's problematic because:  
• ping is often used to establish activity of a target  
• Nmap by default use ping to establish target activity  
  
  
Which means that maped host will be registered as dead or won't be scanned at all.  
  
To go around this configuration Nmap provides a **-Pn** flag which tells Nmap not to ping host before scanning. Nmap will treat all host targets as alive bypassing ICMP block, but at the same time elongating time needed to complete the scan.   
  
Also when being directly in local network Nmap can use ARP request to determine host activity.  
  
Another examples of firewall evasion options:  
◇ **-f**- fragments packets making it less likely to be detected by firewall  
◇ **-mtu <number>**- similiar to " -f " but gives control over packet size (must me multiple of 8)  
◇ **--scan-delay <time>ms**- used to add a delay between sent packets. Used on unstable networks or to avoid time-based firewall / IDS triggers  
◇ **--badsum**- generates invalid checksum for packets. Any real TCP/IP stack would drop this packet however, firewalls may potentailly respond automatically without bothering to check the checksum. It may be used to determine presence of firewall / IDS.
