  
**nmap -sT** - based on three-way handshake, nmap sends request to every port, if it's closed server response with **reset flag (RST)**. But in case of open port server response with SYN/ACK flags, and nmap marks it as an open port.   
  
In case port is hidden behind firewall, TCP SYN request recieve no answer what indicates that port is being **filtered**.   
  
It's easy to configure a firewall to respond with RTS TCP packet, which makes it extremely difficult to get an accurate reading of the target.
