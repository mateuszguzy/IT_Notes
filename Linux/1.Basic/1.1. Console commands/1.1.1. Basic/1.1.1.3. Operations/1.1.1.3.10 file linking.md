Using hard links can be dangerous because it can completely erase data from a file.  
  
A different type of link can be used, symbolic linking (symlink). While hard linked file contains the data of the original file, a symbolic link is just a reference to another file.

While using **ls**it shows that it's linked document and also shows to what file - but **ONLY** for symbolic link. Also despite it has all 777 permissions, it's only a reference so it has the same permissions as the original file.
