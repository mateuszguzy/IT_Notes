sed maintains two data buffers: **pattern space** (active) and **hold space**(auxiliary). Both are initially empty.  
  
sed operates by performing the following cycle on each line of input:  
• reads one line from the input system  
• removes any trailing newline  
• places it in the pattern space  
• execute commands  
• each command can have an address associated to it - they are kind of condition code, and command is only executed if condition if verified.  
  
  
• when the end of script is reached contents of pattern space are printed out to the output stream  
• cycle starts over  
  
  
sed command does not modify original file, it just shows stream with changes.  
  
 Example 1:  
  
changing word "Second", with "another" in file hello.txt  
  
![145-1.png](145-1.png)  
  
here "s" means subtraction. This command change only first occurence of given word in line.  
  
To choose specific line to change use flag showed below:  
  
![145-2.png](145-2.png)  
  
where "/2" change word in second line. To change all occurences use global flag "  
/g".  
  
To change all occurrences starting from one particular use flag:

sed as input also accept regexes:

Delete all whitespaces, using regex:
