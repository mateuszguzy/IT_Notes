  
**sudo** - allows to run any command as a root. Current user password is needed, and not every user is allowed to use sudo command. Sudo can be configured to execute commands as other users.  
  
To switch to root account for a while, use flag:  
  
 sudo -s  
  
If we want to run command as other user than root, a following syntax should be used:  
  
 sudo -u <user> <command>
