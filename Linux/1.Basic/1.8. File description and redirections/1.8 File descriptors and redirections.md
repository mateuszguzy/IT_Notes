In Windows it is called **filehandle**.   
  
In general it's a connection (mostly to a file) from the Operating System to perform I/O operations.  
  
By default in Linux there are three FD's:  
  
• **STDIN** - Data Stream for Input  
• **STDOUT** - Data Stream for Output   
• **STDERR** - Data Stream for Output that relates to an error occurring  
  
  
  
**STDIN and STDOUT** taking a **cat** command as an example. First we type and run **cat** command. It's waiting for input, so we provide it - it's STDIN - FD 0 (green).  
As soon as we confirm the input with ENTER it is returned as standard output STDOUT - FD 1 (red).

**STDOUT and STDERR** taking a **find** command as an example. We can see a standard output STDOUT - FD 1 (green) and standard error STDERR - FD 2 (red)

But if we use **2>/dev/null** we redirect error results into null device which discards all the data, so we can't see any errors.

**Redirecting STDOUT into a file**  
  
Using the same syntax as for “nulling” the errors we can transfer wanted output into the file.  
  

```python
$ find /etc/ -name shadow 2>/dev/null > results.txt
```
  
  
We can also redirect STDOUT and STDERR into different files so we can inspect either output and error messages.  
  

```python
$ find /etc/ -name shadow 2>errors.txt 1>results.txt
```
  
  
To append something to a file instead of overwriting it, we can use double “>” sign.  
  

```python
$ find /etc/ -name passwd >> stdout.txt 2>/dev/null
```
  
  
**Redirect STDIN**  
  
Using file descriptors we can redirect standard outputs and errors with “>” sign.  
  
However “<” sign serves as standard input FD 0 - STDIN.  
  

```python
$ cat < stdout.txt
```
  
  
  
**Redirect STDIN Stream to a File**  
  
We can also use double “<” sign to add standard input through a stream. We can use **end-of-file** (EOF) function in Linux file system, which indicates the input's end. A stream is a consecutive number of inputs. In this case words are written one by one, each accepted with ENTER and after writing EOF the stream ends.
