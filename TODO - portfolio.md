In a couple of years, I aim to be working in Cyber Security in which experience and professional knowledge about APIs will surely be an asset. I also want to work in an international work environment to strengthen my language skills, and maybe catch a British accent ;). I might not have some big professional experience in APIs or in programming in general, but I'm constantly learning and have a great passion for it (and IT) as evidenced by the fact that I've been learning to program by myself for over a year.
