  
**HOST**- device with specify IP address which transfers data from or to another devices  
  
**SERVER**- computer which provides services such as web pages, e-mail or file transfer. Every computer can become a server when appropriate software is installed. I.e.:  
• Apache - helds www pages  
• MySQL - database management  
  
  
**CLIENT** - computer (software) which uses services shared by servers.  
  
**TRANSMISSION MEDIA** - network element by which devices exchange data i.e.:◇   
• cables  
• radio waves (WiFi)  
  
  
**COMMUNICATION PROTOCOL** - method of communication and data exchange, specifying rules of this communication i.e.:  
• http  
• ftp  
• ssh  
  
  
**IPv4 ADDRESS**- 32-bit number shown in it's decimal character (i.e.: 192.168.32.200), allows to identify device in net and address the data.  
  
**INTERNET** - set of wide networks creating global computer network  
  
**INTRANET** - private network which uses the same communication standards like internet but with limited access i.e. only by company employees  
  
**EXTRANET** - expanded version of intranet, which is available for larger group of users i.e.: company employees + company clients  
  
**DNS**- (Domain Name System) - net service changing names understandable for human to IP addresses of network devices. Basic internet function, changes domain name to IP address allowing connection to the server, i.e.:  
• onet.pl => 214.180.141.140  
  
  
**DHCP** - (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) - automatic net configuration protocol, which assign host their IP addresses, subnet masks, gateway addresses and DNS servers. Most common way to assign IP address to computers in network, because it doesn't require to do it manually.  
  
**DATA TRANSFER UNIT** - smallest unit is 1 [b] (bit), file size is shown in 1 [B] (byte), but network transfer capacity is shown in bits / second. Conversion: 1 [B] = 8 [b].  
  
**MAC ADDRESS**- physical address, 48-bit number encoded in hexadecimal system on network card of an end device. Example of address form: **28-80-23-D6-BE-14**. It's divided in two equal parts, "**28-80-23**" is a producer identifier, "**D6-BE-14**" is a card identifier. Whole number is used to find hosts in local networks (LAN). This number, on source host and on router connects our local network with WAN in encapsulation process in link layer in TCP/IP and in data link in ISO/OSI.  
  
**IP ADDRESS** - logical address, used to transfer data between hosts located in different networks separated by hundreds of kilometers.  
  
**PORT NUMERATION** - signs data into specific application in OS. Each application has it's own port number, so the data will not be send into wrong spot, i.e. e-mail, into web browser.

**SOCKET** - in networks - is combined number of IP address and port number. It works as an endpoint or a bidirectional inter-process communication flow across the internet. In simple words computers connect to each other through sockets, and communicate through it.
