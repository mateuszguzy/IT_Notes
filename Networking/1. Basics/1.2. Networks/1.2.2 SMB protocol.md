  
**Server Message Block Protocol (SMB)** - client server communication protocol, used for sharing access to files, printers, serial ports and other. It's a response-request protocol, which means it transmits multiple messages between client ans server to establish connection. Connection is established using TCP/IP, NetBEUI or IPX/SPX.

Once connection is established, clients send commands (SMBs) to the server which allows them to access shares, open/read/write files.  
  
Windows has included client and server support for SMB protocol. On Unix there is Samba which supports SMB protocol.
