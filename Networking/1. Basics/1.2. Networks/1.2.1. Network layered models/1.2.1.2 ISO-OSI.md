  
**Reference model**- rather used to analyze, and better understand communication processes in network. It's blueprint for developing also hardware like software solutions.  
  
**Layers:**  
  
• **application**- allows users to use network services like www, e-mail or file transfer. Only layer in which user has any interaction, others are out of his reach.  
• **presentation**- tells application layer about data format i.e. what file types are going to be transfered, also it's responsible for encoding the data on source device and decoding on end device  
• **session** - manage users sessions i.e. www pages or video communication  
• **transport**- responsible for efficient communication service between devices. In this layer data is divided on smaller parts and attached additional information allowing to allocate it to specified application on end device but also allowing to put in right order.  
• **network** -responsible for finding fastest and shortest path to end device through WAN, and also addressing data with use of IP addresses  
• **data link** - manage access control to transmission media, and also addressing the data in this case to transfer them between LAN hosts  
• **physical** - encodes the data to pure zeros and ones, and transfer it through the transmission media to specific devices
