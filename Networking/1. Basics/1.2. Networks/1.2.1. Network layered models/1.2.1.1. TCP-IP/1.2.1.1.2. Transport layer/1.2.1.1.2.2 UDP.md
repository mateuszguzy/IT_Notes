  
**UDP** - User Datagram Protocol   
• connection less protocol  
• biggest advantage is small amount of data assigned during encapsulation process  
• segments send via this protocol are called **DATAGRAMS**  
• applications using UDP:  
 ◇ DNS  
 ◇ DHCP  
 ◇ video streaming  
 ◇ VoIP  
  
  
**UDP datagram format**

Connection less **protocol** means that transfer is started without previous communication (like three-way handshake).   
  
Higher mentioned applications using UDP protocol, are focused on data transfer speed rather than on receiving all data segments.
