  
**TCP**- Transmission Control Protocol   
  
• more complex than UDP  
• connection protocol (three-way handshake - below)  
• guarantees reliable data delivery and flow control   
• larger amount of data assigned during encapsulation (needed for reliability)  
• applications using TCP:  
  
 • web browsers  
 • email services  
 • FTP

Before servers sends any data to client, a connection between them has to be established. Process description:  
• client send segment with **SYN flag** (flag is a 1bit control field added to segment header; SYN flag is a flag for sequence number synchronization). Segment also contains random client sequence number called **ISN** (Initial Sequence Number), used for further data merging. Receiving this number server acknowledges that client want to obtain connection.  
• in response server send confirmation segment with **SYN ACK** flag, sequence number send by client increased by 1, and it's own random sequence number  
• in response client sends to server segment with **ACK** flag, confirming receiving previous message, with server sequence number increased by 1.  
  
  
After data transfer **session closure** occurs

• client informs about will to end session, sending segment with **FIN** flag  
• server in response sends segment with **FIN ACK** flag, to confirm segment was received  
• next server sends segment with **FIN** flag  
• client in response sends segment with **FIN ACK** flag  
  
  
**TCP reliability** - sending data receiving confirmation, after some portion of data.  
  
Description:  
• assuming that data segment will be 1000 byte large, it will have sequence number equal 1  
• client after receiving data segment will respond to server with segment equal 1001, which means that data is received next should start at 1001 byte  
• next 1000 bytes are send  
• client response with segment 2001 and so on  
  
  
To speed delivery process, few data segments are send and client sends only one confirmation i.e. after three received segments. Data size transferred without confirmation is called **window size.** If during transfer client will notice, that some data segment is lost, it can send server an information about decreasing window size. After some time, window size returns to it's default size, defined at three-way handshake. Window size change during transmission is called **dynamic window**.
