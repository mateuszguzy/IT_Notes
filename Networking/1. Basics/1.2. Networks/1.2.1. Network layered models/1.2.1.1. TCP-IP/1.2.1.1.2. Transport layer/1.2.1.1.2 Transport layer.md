  
It's two most important tasks is to:  
  
• obtain and maintain connection called **session** between two end devices   
• reliable communication handling.   
  
  
These two main tasks are possible through row of other actions:  
  
• tracking connection / conversation between hosts  
• data division on smaller fragments possible to transfer through network  
• allows to exchange data between many applications at once, it's also possible thanks to data fragmentation which allows to send small chunks of different applications. If the data wouldn't be divided only one application at the time could receive data. Process of sending different application in fragments is called **multiplexing**.  
  
  
Application identification for port assignment responsible is organization called **IANA** (Internet Assigned Numbers Authority). Ports are divided into three main categories:  
  
• well known - 0 - 1023 - services and server application  
• registered - 1024 - 49151 - user services and applications  
• dynamic - 49152 - 65535 - randomly chosen for client application (i.e. client request web page from www server, request is send to port 80, but response is send to a random number taken from dynamic numbers pool)  
  
  
Data flow control  
  
Each host has limited resources for RAM or data transfer speed, to avoid overloading the OS or link between devices, and to provide correct data flow a data flow control is provided. It specify data package after which host needs to send receiving confirmation. It's only provided by TCP protocol.
