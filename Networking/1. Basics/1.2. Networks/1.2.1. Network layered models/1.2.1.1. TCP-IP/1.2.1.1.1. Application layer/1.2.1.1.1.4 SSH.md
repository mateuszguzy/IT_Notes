  
**SSH**- Secure Shell, protocol user by admins to manage servers. Communication provided by SSH is encrypted, and default encrypting algorithm is **RSA**, it's also possible to encrypt data with use or weaker algorithm **DSA**.   
  
During creation of SSH server, a pair of keys is created, to encrypt and decrypt the data  
• public key  
• private key  
  
  
During first connection to server, client saves server public key in local directory called **known\_hosts**, and next creates **session key** used to encrypt whole client-server communication. Session key, is encrypted by public key, and it's send to server. From now on whole communication is encrypted by session key. By default SSH works on **port 22**. Most common app and free for SSH creation is PuTTY.  
  
SSH is a successor of previous application protocol called Telnet. Comparing to SSH, Telnet was not secure due to sending messages in plain text, and having no specific security mechanisms.
