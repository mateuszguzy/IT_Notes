  
**DNS** -Domain Name System, net service changing names understandable for human to IP addresses of network devices. Basic internet function, changes domain name to IP address allowing connection to the server, i.e.:  
• onet.pl => 214.180.141.140  
  
In case of IP address change, it's enough to only change it on DNS, no need to inform everyone about it.   
  
DNS is an protocol working in client-server structure, but it's not typical like in other cases. On client OS there is installed DNS resolver which works on every application on client computer which needs name changing to IP address.  
  
DNS servers hold different types of records  
• A records - addresses of end devices  
• MX records - addresses of mail servers  
  
  
If DNS doesn't hold required IP address, it connects with other DNS servers in search. When found server saves in cache IP address of server on which required address was found, so in future it will not need to search through all of them again.
