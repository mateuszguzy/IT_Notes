It's automatic net configuration protocol, which assign host their IP addresses, subnet masks, gateway addresses and DNS servers. Most common way to assign IP address to computers in network, because it doesn't require to do it manually.  
  
Server DHCP can be placed separately to work for all client computers on network, or can be placed on already existing server (www, DNS, AD (Active Directory) as an service. Nowadays also net routers have ability to configure DHCP service.  
  
DHCP is called active allocation and it's very useful for managing larger networks. Each DHCP server holds certain amount of IP addresses which it rents to connected devices in network. Some devices like www servers, data bases, active directory, printers or routers must have manually set addresses because they must be constant. If any device is removed from the network, it's IP address is taken back to DHCP pool. Also when setting DHCP server admin sets time after which IP addresses for devices are changed.
