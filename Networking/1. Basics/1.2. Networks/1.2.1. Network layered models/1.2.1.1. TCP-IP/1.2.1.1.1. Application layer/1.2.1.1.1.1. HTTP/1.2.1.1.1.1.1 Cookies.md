Cookies have huge number of uses, and most common are session management or advertising (cookies tracking). Cookies are sent with every HTTP request made to a server.   
  
Use of cookies is forced by HTTP itself, because it's **stateless**. Each request made with use of HTTP is independent and not tracked internally. Cookies are a solution to web sites to track of data, like i.e. items stored in shopping cart, who you are or what what is done to the website.  
  
Cookies are made of few pieces.

Cookies are normally sent with request to the site that set them. The server is what normally sets cookies, and these come in the response headers **"Set-Cookie"**. Alternatively these can be set from JavaScript inside your browser.   
  
Cookies can be used to stole someones identity on website. When logged into web application user receives **Session Token**, by which he is identified. This token can be stolen.  
  
Cookies can also be manipulated. In developer tools, in storage tab, all cookies set by webpage are stored. Also new cookies can be add by user.  
  
Nowadays more webpages use **LocalStorage** and **SessionStorage**. This has a familiar function but isn't sent with HTTP request by default. These are features of HTML5.
