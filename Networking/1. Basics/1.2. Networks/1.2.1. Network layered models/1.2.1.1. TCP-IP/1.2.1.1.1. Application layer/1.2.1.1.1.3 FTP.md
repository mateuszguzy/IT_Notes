FTP client is present on every OS, and can be access i.e. by console, but it's easier to use dedicated application. If we use FTP only to download files, it can be accessed by browser (most of them has installed FTP client inside)  
  
To obtain successful FTP communication, two connections between client-server need to be made. First on **port 21** is called **steering transmission**, is used only for commands and communicates. Second is on **port 20** and it's used to **transfer files**.   
  
To secure access to FTP, user authorization is provided. Sometimes when access for multiple users is wanted, it's provided via anonymous user, so authorization is not required. Such solution is available only for data download, never for upload.  
  
FTP has two channels:  
• command / control channel  
• data channel  
  
  
Separation of that two channels allow to send commands to server during data transfer. In other situation user would be allowed to enter commands only between transfers.  
  
Connection types:  
• Active FTP - client opens a port and listens. Server is required to actively connect to it.  
• Passive FTP - server opens a port and listens (passively), while client connects to it.
