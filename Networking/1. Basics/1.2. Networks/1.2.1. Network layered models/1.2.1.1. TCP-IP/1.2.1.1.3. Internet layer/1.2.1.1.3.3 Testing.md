Can be done on any OS. On windows and Linux user can use **Ping** program, started from the console. It test connection between hosts. Both OS's can also use program **Tracert** to test connection between starting host and destination host. In Linux core systems this program is named **Traceroute**.   
  
**Ping** is using different internet layer protocol called **ICMP** (Internet Control Message Protocol), which sends **Echo Request**, after receiving it, shows response time. Thanks to this information, we can estimate network efficiency.   
   
Ping can be used to test:  
   
• **local stack**- which is testing local computer network configuration (apply command " ping " and loop-back address)  
• **LAN connection** - i.e. gateway address  
• **WAN connection** - i.e. web domain, sometimes it's impossible because admins restrict or forbid transfer IMCP datagrams into their network because of security reasons  
  
  
**Route testing**It also uses ICMP protocol, and Echo Request, but it tests how many routers has packet to cross before achieve end device.

With use of this tool, we can check every hop, and see which router is most overloaded.  
  
  
**IMCP Protocol** It can be used to more tasks than only network testing. It can:  
• send information about router overloading  
• inform about low network bandwidth  
• mutual routers detecting in internet
