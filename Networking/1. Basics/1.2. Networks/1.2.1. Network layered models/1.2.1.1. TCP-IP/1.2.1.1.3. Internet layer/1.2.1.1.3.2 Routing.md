To transfer data from one network to another, host needs to know IP address of **default gateway**. Gateway, router interface or server is an IP address connected in the same LAN as host (on picture, default gateway for left LAN network is marked green).  
  
Setting default gateway is not needed when DHCP is in use, but if IP addresses are set statically, it can be done by editing network card settings.  
  
To check default gateway address on windows, use **ipconfig** command in command interface.   
  
Every host in network, even router interface, has **routing table**, which contains information about routes to destination networks for both connected and far away networks.   
  
**Example of routing table**

For host "0", routers "1", and "2" are connected networks, rest of them are far away networks. Router "0" has information about far away networks, from other routers with use or **RIP protocol.**   
  
Data transfer is executed by router which checks if in it's routing table is present IP address of an end device, and if it is, data is transferred to next hop router. If in routing table is no IP address, data packet is denied, and only **default route** can help. Default route is used only when no other route to end device can be provided. Default route has address **0.0.0.0** and has to be manually written into routing table by admin.  
  
**Routing types** • **static**- network admin is responsible for manual update routes on router, as for manually assigning IP addresses on users computers. It's pros are: more reliable than dynamic, and use less of computing power of router. It's biggest con it need of manual update of every route  
  
• **dynamic**- computers are learning routes by their own. They get these information from other routers, without admin interference. Biggest pros is, that any change in network topology doesn't require manual update. Biggeest con is that it uses much larger amount of computing power of router. Every change in routing table involves a lot of new calculations. Also information exchange between routers generates bigger network traffic. Most common dynamic routing protocols:  
  
 • RIP (ver. 1 & 2)  
 • EIGRP  
 • OSPF
