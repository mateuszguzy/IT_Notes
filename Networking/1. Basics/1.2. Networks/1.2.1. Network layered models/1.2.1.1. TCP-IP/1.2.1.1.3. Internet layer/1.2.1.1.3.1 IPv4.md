  
**IP address** It's an address of a network interface NOT a device. One device can have multiple IP addresses, because it has i.e. few network cards (servers). It's also the most popular protocol. It's an open one, which means it doesn't belong to any company and it can cooperate with many producent products  
  
Protocol features:  
  
• adds small amount of steering data  
• it's connection less  
• works in name of **best effort** - doesn't use flow control or delivery confirmations, but does his best to make communication succesfull  
• it's media independent - it means that data can be transferred no matter what transmission media are used  
  
  
Due to media independence IP protocol works for every transmission media (twin-twisted wire, optical fiber or radio waves), only problem which may occur transferring data through different media is **MTU**(Maximum Transmission Unit). If data package is to big, router in network will divide it into smaller pieces, and this process is called **fragmentation**.  
  
**Process description:**• packet is send without previous information (connection less)  
• during encapsulation via IPv4, end address and home address are assigned  
• packet is not tracked   
• packet is transferred via optical fiber, twin-twisted wire and router  
• in one of transmission media packet has to be divided on smaller pieces because of MTU - fragmentation  
• no delivery confirmation is send  
  
  
**IPv4 header format** ![807-1.png](807-1.png)  
   
**source address**- IP address of data sender, helpful when receiver want to response to the sender  
  
**destination address** - IP address of data receiver  
  
**TTL (Time to Live)**- maximum number of jumps before packet is declined. One **hop** is one router on data way from source to destination. Value of TTL field is decreased by one after each router, and if it reaches 0, packet is no longer transferred. This mechanism is helpful with packet loops, which occur when for some reason destination address cannot be reached.  
  
**type of service** - describes priority with which packet is operated by router. Example types are: VoIP, video stream etc. and router decides which one of them has to be operated at first  
  
**protocol** - information about transport layer protocol used to communicate  
  
**flags / fragment offset** - information helpful to assemble packet on destination if it was fragmented on it's way  
  
  
**Data addressing** Hosts in networks are divided for easier management and addressing. Firstly data reaches specific network to which end device is connected, and then is transferred to end device. This type of addressing is called **hierarchical addressing**. I.e.:   
  
192.168.1. 15  
  
network host  
address address  
  
  
  
IP addressed used by IPv4 protocol are build from 32bits divided into four groups called **octets** (beacuse each number consist of 8bits). Each octet can adopt number from 0 to 255.  
  
Which part of bits is designated to network address and which to host address is defined by **net mask** (called also **subnet mask** i.e. **255.255.255.0**) which defines network size and hosts number. Mask address also contains 32bit number. There is also shorthand notation i.e. **/24** which means number of "1" in mask address. Shorthand notation is possible because in case of mask address, "1" defines network size, and "0" hosts. In mask address "1" are always going from left to right one after another, there is no situation when some "0" is between the "1" (like in IP address).  
  
Examples of mask addresses

Addressing types:  
  
• classfull - use of predefined classes (A, B, C, D, E), which define upfront possible number of addressed networks and possible hosts working in those networks  
  
default mask networks hosts  
  
• A - 255.0.0.0 128 16 777 215   
• B - 255.255.0.0 168384 65 534  
• C - 255.255.255.0 2 097 152 254  
• D - group addresses  
• E - experimental addresses, reserved by **IANA**(Internet Assigned Numbers Authority)  
  
  
  
• classless - don't use predefined classes, number of hosts and size of network is defined by admin with use of **subnet masks**, to create **sub nets**.  
  
To create subnets, we need to "take" some "0" from host part of mask address, i.e.:  
  
255.255.255.0 /24  
  
11111111.11111111.11111111.00000000 -> 1 network  
  
11111111.11111111.11111111.10000000 -> 2 networks  
  
11111111.11111111.11111111.11000000 -> 4 networks  
  
Number of subnets: 2^n, where n = number of "taken" bits from host part.  
  
By creating **more subnets**, number of available host in each subnet is **decreasing** (less host zeros). Use equation below.  
  
Main network address can be assigned as address of first subnet. Address of any other subnet is a broadcast address of previous subnet increased by one.  
  
**VLSM**(Variable Length Subnet Mask) - technique used when there's need for i.e. odd number of subnets with unequal hosts number. With this techniqe we change submask length to suit need of subnet hosts. To visualize, first we divide network into two subnets 126 host each, then second subnet is divided into another two subnets 62 hosts each.   
  
IP address: 192.168.1.0  
First subnet address: 192.168.1.0  
Second subnet address: 192.168.1.128  
Third subnet address: 192.168.1.192  
  
  
**Data transmission types**• unicast - most common, used in typical connections between two hosts i.e. client - server web page request  
• multicast - helps to reduce network bandwidth usage, because one packet is send to many devices at one. It can be used by routers to exchange information about routing but also to software distribution. In multicast special pool of addresses is used, it's called **group addresses**(from **224.0.0.0** to **239.255.255.255**)  
• broadcast - sending packets to all hosts in current network. It's using special address called **broadcast address**, so not every host IP address is known. Most commonly used in LAN.  
  
  
**Special IP addresses**127.0.0.1 - 127.255.255.254 - loop-backs   
  
• Address of itself. every host in network, beside IP address used for data transfer, has also IP address of itself, most commonly used is 127.0.0.1. Every address from that range can be used to check host configuration. If used " ping " command in console on any of this addresses return " true ", then network configuration on this address is correct.  
  
• 169.254.0.1 - 169.254.255.254 - local link  
  
• Used when different IP address option is not available i.e. when DHCP server is not available for some reason, and there is no static IP address assigned. Data transmission can only work in LAN where given host is connected  
  
• 192.0.2.0 - 192.0.2.254 - test net  
  
• Can only be used within LAN. Used for education reasons, that's why should only be used temporary.  
  
  
**Public and private addresses**  
  
Public addresses are used in WAN communication, they are uqniue which means, that only one address in whole network can have this IP address. Private addresses are used in LAN, and are also unique, but only in range of one LAN network.  
  
Public address is provided by **ISP** (Internet Service Provider), in most cases ISP shares only one public IP address. To allow all hosts in LAN network to use the internet, **NAT** (Network Address Translation) service is used. It translates private IP addresses of hosts to public address so they can access the internet. All host in LAN are visible in internet by the same public address (when ISP provided only one). Public IP address can be checked on specified webpages.◇   
  
**Calculating network address**   
 IP address: 192.168.1.145  
mask address: 255.255.255.128  
  
  
Step 1: (conversion to binary number)  
  
192.168.1.145 = 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 . 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 . 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 . 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1   
  
255.255.255.128 = 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 . 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 . 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 . 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 ◇   
  
  
Step 2: (multiply numbers in columns, operation AND(.))  
  
1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 . 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 . 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 . 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0  
  
  
Step 3: (conversion to decimal number)   
  
**192.168.1.128 = network address**   
**Calculating broadcast address**   
Step 1: (operation NOT on mask address)  
  
255.255.255.128 = 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 . 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 . 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 . 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0   
 - NOT = 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 . 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 . 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 . 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1   
  
  
  
Step 2:(conversion to decimal number)  
  
0.0.0.127  
  
Step 3: (adding number after conversion to network address)  
  
0.0.0.127  
192.168.1.128  
 **192.168.1.255 = broadcast address**  
 **Calculating max host number** equation: 2^(number of bits in IP address - shorthand mask address) - 2  
  
2^(32-25) - 1 = 2^7 - 2 = 128 - 2 = **126 hosts  
   
 First host IP address** if network address is: 192.168.1.128  
then first host address is: 192.168.1.129  
 **Last host IP address**  
  
if broadcast address is: 192.168.1.255  
then last host address is: 192.168.1.254
