**Layers:**• **application** - allows users to use network services like www, e-mail or file transfer. Only layer in which user has any interaction, others are out of his reach.  
• **transport** - responsible for efficient communication service between devices. In this layer data is divided on smaller parts and attached additional information allowing to allocate it to specified application on end device but also allowing to put in right order.  
• **internet** - responsible for finding fastest and shortest path to end device through WAN, and also addressing data with use of IP addresses  
• **link** - encodes the data to the character of zeros and ones, passes through to transmitting media, and also address it with use of physical address - MAC  
  
  
**Communication model** It defines protocols work, which create so called protocol packages which are called "stack". In example: if browser want's to view web page, the **application layer** will use HTTP protocol, next **transport layer** will use TCP or UPD protocol, next **internet layer** will use IP protocol and **link layer** will use i.e. Ethernet standard.   
  
Communication works on whole set of protocols, set in stack, one after another. Only use of whole stack of protocols guarantees it's correct work.

**Basic process description**  
  
In **application** **layer** user, creates data i.e. server www request. Next data is send to **transport layer** in which become divided on smaller parts, next to **internet layer** where IP address is signed which allows to send data through WAN and last to **link layer** where MAC address is signed. Then data is put into transmission media and send via intermediary devices to end device. This whole proccess is called **encapsulation**.   
  
On end device, whole process is made in reveres (up the stack), and it's called **de-encapsulation**.  
  
During the process and adding additional data, main data structure is changed. General name of data transferred through network is PDU (Protocol Data Units). But on each stage of encapsulation process data has it's own seperate name.  
  
• application-data  
• transport-segment / datagram (depends on used layer protocol)  
• internet-packet  
• link-frame
