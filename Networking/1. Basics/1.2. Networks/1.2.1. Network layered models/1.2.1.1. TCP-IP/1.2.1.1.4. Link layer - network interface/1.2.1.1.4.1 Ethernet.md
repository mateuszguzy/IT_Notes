  
Is a communication protocol, combining functions of network layer, and physical layer. Most commonly used in LAN, sometimes in MAN or WAN.   
  
Care of this technology takes IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers), which assigned to it numbers:  
• 802.2 - it's related to LLC functions   
• 802.3 - it's related to MAC and physical layer

• preamble & SFD (Start Frame Delimiter) - informs end device to prepare to receive frame  
• destination address - MAC  
• source address - MAC  
• length / type - length declares size of packet / type declares higher layer protocol i.e. IPv4  
• data payload - contains packet received from network layer, if packet is smaller then 46 bytes it's size is increased by assigning random data  
• FCS - used for error detection, sender calculates check sum and places it in frame, destination host also calculates check sum and compares it with one send by source. If check sums are different frame is considered as broken and is rejected  
  
  
Maximum size of ethernet frame is 1518 bytes, because preamble is not added to sum.
