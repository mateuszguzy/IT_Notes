  
**Types by area:**• LAN- Local Area Network - small area network i.e. workshop, home  
• MAN - Metropolitan Area Network - network covering area of a city or aglomeration  
• WAN - Wide Area Network - combined LAN & MAN  
  
  
**Type by architecture**:  
  
• client-server - one or few servers sharing data between connecred computers (clients)  
• peer to peer (P2P) - lots of computers on equal rights, every connected computer simultanously shares and downloads data.  
  
 **Network topology**   
Describes relation between devices in one network, connections between them and type of data flow.  
  
Types:  
  
• physical - describes connections between devices  
 ◇ bus

 ◇ ring

• logical - describes communication method between devices  
  
 ◇ point to point - data is transferred only from one point to another. Can be connected directly or with use of intermediate devices

 ◇ ring - each device analyze data if it's addressed to it, if not it's transferred forward

 ◇ mutli-access - every computer in network sees data, but only target has access to them

Access control mechanisms:  
  
→ **CSMA/CD**- collision detection, if sender device detects that link is free, it starts the transfer, meanwhile when another device start to send it's data, the transfer is interrupted, after some time transfer attempt is repeated. Used in old Ethernet networks.  
→ **CSMA/CA**- collision avoidance, if sender device detects that link is free it sends information about will to transfer. Used in wireless networks.  
→ **Token Passing** - transferring between devices some data package (token), so device which is in the possesion of token is allowed to start download.
