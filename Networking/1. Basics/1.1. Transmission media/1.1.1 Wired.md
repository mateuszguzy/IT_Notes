1. Coaxial cable (BNC input/output)  
  
![792-1.png](792-1.png)![792-2.png](792-2.png)  
  
• thin   
 • diameter: 5 mm  
 • max. length: 185 m  
 • net standard: 10base-2  
 • max. bandwidth: 10 Mb/s (limited by Ethernet standard not wire possibility)  
  
  
• thick  
 • diameter: 10 mm  
 • max. length: 500 m  
 • net standard: 10base-5  
 • max. bandwidth: 10 Mb/s (limited by Ethernet standard not wire possibility)  
  
  
  
2. twisted pair cable(RJ45 or different name 8P8C input/output)

Types:  
  
• UTP - not screened cable  
 • U/UTP - not screened cable  
 • F/UTP - foiled cable  
  
• FTP - foil screened cable   
 • U/FTP - each pair foiled separately  
 • F/FTP - each pair foiled separately AND whole cable foiled  
 • S/FTP - each pair foiled separately AND whole cable in net  
  
  
• STP - net screened cable  
  
  
Categories:  
  
• 3 - Ethernet 10Base-T   
• 5/5e - FastEthernet 100Base-TX / GigaEthernet 1000Base-T  
• 6 - GigabitEthernet 1000Base-T  
• 6a - 10-GigabitEthernet 10GBase-T  
• 7 - 10-GigabitEthernet 10GBase-T  
  
  
Parameters:  
  
• return loss - [db] - ratio of input signal to amount of signal that is reflected back towards the transmitter which is caused by variations of impedance in the connectors and cable   
• signal propagation - [%] - ratio of electrical impulse compared to speed of light in percent  
• resistance - [ohm]   
• max. bend radius - in most cases R = 4 x diameter  
  
  
Pros:  
• low cost  
• easy assembly  
• easy to diagnose and repair   
  
Cons:  
• vulnerable to electromagnetic field noise  
• low distance between nods (100m)  
• lower bandwidth than optic fiber  
  
  
**Optical fiber**  
  
Instead of copper wire, like in other cables, root is made out of drawing glass (silica), and transfer signal is changed from electricity to light ray (most common is infrared)

Cable ends (most common):  
  
• ST  
![792-6.png](792-6.png)  
  
• SC

• FC

one-mode - only one light ray, can be transferred at very long distance, without use of signal strenghtening devices   
multi-mode - few light rays, bigger signal blur, each ray has different path to make, between sender and reciever, usually used at distance up to few kilometers  
  
Pros:  
  
• big bandwidth  
• long distance transmission  
• low vulnerability to magnetic field noise  
  
  
Cons:  
  
• signal blur  
• hard to assembly  
• expensive net gear
