  
MySQL is a RDBMS (Relational Data Base Management System) based on SQL language. Which means it helps in the administration of a database organized as tables (relational). It works on client-server model using SQL language to communicate.   
  
MySQL is made up of the server and utility program that helps in the administration of MySQL databases. Server handles all database instructions, takes and manages requests and communicates in MySQL protocol.   
  
Simplified process:  
• MySQL creates a database for storing and manipulating data  
• clients make requests by making specific statements in SQL  
• server responds to the client with whatever information has been requested  
  
  
Key terminology:  
• SCHEMA - in MySQL SQL syntax schema and database can be used as substitute.   
• HASH - product of cryptographic algorithm, taking a variable length input and giving fixed length output. In MySQL hashes can be used to index data into a hash table. Each hash has a unique ID that serves as a pointer to original data. Created hash index is much smaller than original data which allows to access data more efficient.
