  
Golden rule in making commits is to group topics into one commit. This means separate files and even parts of the files.

To make that happen:  
  

```python
git add -p index.html
```
  
  
That command shows all changes made in a file chunk by chunk and asks if given change should be placed in current commit (y / n)

After checking Git status we see that index.html is listed in both files as committed and changed.
