Most SQLi happen within the WHERE clause of SELECT query, but it can also happen in any other place in the query and for other query types.  
  
Other statements are:  
  
• UPDATE where we provide updated values or WHERE clause  
• INSERT where we provide new inserted values  
• SELECT within a table or column name, and with ORDER by clause
