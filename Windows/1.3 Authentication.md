  
In Windows local authentication is done using Local Security Authority (LSA). It is a protected subsystem that keeps track of local security policies and the accounts that are on a computer system. It also maintains information about all aspects of local security on a computer.  
  
Active Directory - is a Windows developed directory service for Windows domain services. Which includes two types:  
  
1. On-Premise Active Directory (AD)  
  
Has record of all users, PCs and Servers and authenticates the users signing in (network logon). Once signed in AD also manages what users are allowed to do and what not.  
  
In AD environment the authentication can be made by using the following protocols:  
  
 1.1 NTLM / NTLM 2  
   
 NTLM uses a challenge-response sequence of messages between a client and a server system, and provides authentication based on that scheme. It doesn't provide data integrity or data confidentiality protection for the authenticated network connection.

 Process scheme:  
   
 1. Client sends a login request to the server. This is also known as a Type 1 message and contains a list of features supported by the client and requested of the server.  
 2. Server respondes with a Type 2 message, which contains the agreed-upon features and a random string (the challenge).  
 3. Client responds with a Type 3 message, containing its response to the challenge and, in the case of NTLMv2, a little something extra.  
 4. Server processes the response (in a domain environment, the server will send the username, challenge, and response to a DC to do this work), using its copy of the user's hash as the key, and compares the result with the challenge. If they match, the client is authenticated.  
  
 What is a challenge?  
   
 Challenge is a encrypted message with use of a user's hash. In Windows hashes are password equivalent. In NTLM and Kerberos user hash is the input in the process. To so not risk sending user hash over network, a challenge is prepared to confirm that user required authentication has access to proper credentials (hash).   
   
 1.2 LDAP / LDAPS   
   
 **Lightweight** **Directory Authentication Protocol**. Main difference between these two is that LDAPS uses encryption. Using these protcols user's workstation send the credentials using API to the Domain Controller in order to validate them and be able to log in.

 1.3 KERBEROS  
  
 Kerberos uses symmetric-key authentication and requires trusted third-party authorization to verify user identities.

2. Azure Active Directory (AAD)  
   
Is a online authentication store, which can contain users and groups. Users have a username and a password which are used when they sign in to an application that uses AAD. All Microsoft Cloud services use AAD. AAD supports following authentication methods:  
  
 2.1 SAML  
   
 **Security Assertion Markup Language**. Is a type of **Single Sign-ON** **(SSO)**. It defines a set of rules/protocols that allow users to access web app with a single login. It's possible because all apps (Service Providers) trust the system that verifies users identities (Indetity Providers).  
   
 Service Providers - these are the system and application that users access throughout the day  
   
 Indetity Providers - system that perform user authentication  
   
 2.2 OAUTH 2.0  
  
 Is a standard that apps use to provide client applications with access. Main roles are:  
   
 - authorization server - which is the server that issues the access token  
 - resource owner - normally your app's end-user that grants permission to access the resource server with an access token  
 - client - wich is the app that request the access token, and then passes it to the resource server.  
 - resource server - which accepts the access token and must verify that it is valid. In the case, that is your application.  
   
 2.3 OpenID Connect  
  
 Authentication standard built on top of OAuth 2.0. It adds an additional token called an ID token. For that it uses simple **JSON Web Tokens (JWT)**. While OAuth 2.0 is about resource access and sharing, OIDC is all about user authentication.
