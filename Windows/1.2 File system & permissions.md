  
In windows, couple folders contain more useful informations than other. I.e.:  
  
• PerfLogs - stores system issues and other reports regarding performance  
• Program Files - default program installation path  
• Program Files (x86) - default program installation path  
• Users - stores information about created users, and data they created  
• Windows - contains OS code, and utility tools  
  
File permissions:  
  
They can be applied to users or groups.  
  
Persmissions can be set to:  
  
• full control - allows to set ownership of the folder or set permission for others  
• modify - allows to modify, read, write and execute  
• read & execute   
• list folders content   
• read  
• write  
• special permissions   
  
To set file or folder permissions use “Security” tab in "Properties".  
  
Tool used to check files and folders permissions is called “**icacls**”.  
  
Example:  
  
![images/848-1.png](images/848-1.png)  
  
Where:  
  
- I - permission inherited from the parent container  
- F - full access (control)  
- M - modify right  
- OI - object inherited  
- IO - inherit only  
- CI - container only  
- RX - read and execute  
- AD - append data (add subdirectories)  
- WD - write data and add files  
  
With use of icacls permissions can be set, remove or denied.
