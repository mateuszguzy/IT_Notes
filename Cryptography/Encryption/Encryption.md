Symmetric - uses the same key to encrypt and decrypt. Examples are DES (broken) and AES.  
Algorithms are faster then asymetric and use smaller keys (128 or 256 bits, DES and AES are 56 bits  
long)  
  
Asymetric - uses pair of keys to encrypt and the other pair to decrypt the data. Examples are **RSA**  
and **Eliptic Curve Cryptography**. Normally there keys are reffered to as **public and private key**.  
Data encrypted with private key can be decrypted with public and vice versa. Private key needs to be  
kept private. Asymetric encryption tends t be slower and uses larger keys i.e. RSA is 2048 to 4096  
bits long.
