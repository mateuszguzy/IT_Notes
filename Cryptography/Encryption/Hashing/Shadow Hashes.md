  
**/etc/shadow** is Linux file for storing password hashes. It also stores other information like date of last password change or password expiration info. To get to this file, root privileges are necessary.  
  
Both files /etc/shadow and /etc/passwd are created of GECOS fields. These are fields separated by colons " **:** ".
