  
Two basic Pandas data types are **DataFrame** and **Series**.   
  
DataFrame is two dimensional and contains info about row and column, when Series occurs only when we are working on single column. Series are a list equivalent.   
  
Pandas transform every column into a attribute so that we can call it in two different ways:  
  

```python
data['cloumn\_name']  
# OR  
data.column\_name
```
  
  
When we want to print whole row by calling data present in it, we need to first state which column it going to be searched through and then give data name  
  

```python
data[data.column\_name == 'row\_data'] # will print whole row containing 'row\_data'
```
  
  
We can also assign whole row to a variable, and extract info from it like from a column.  
  

```python
monday = data[data.day == 'monday']  
  
monday.temp  
------------------------------  
  
0 24
```
