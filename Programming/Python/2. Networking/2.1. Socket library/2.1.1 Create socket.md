 import socket  
   
As example, a code which connect to pr4e.org. When defining socket first parameter indicates that connection is going through the internet, second one defines port we are willing to connect to.  
  

```python
import socket  
mysock=socket.socket(socket.AF\_INET, socket.SOCK\_STREAM)	#socket library using function socket, to define user wanted socket type  
mysock.connect(('data.pr4e.org', 80)
```
  
  
**socket.AF\_INET** - designates address family on socket. This case is IPv4 address. To create a socket an address family has to be specified to properly communicate with it. Linux supports 29 different address families e.g. UNIX (AF\_UNIX), Bluetooth (AF\_BLUETOOTH) or IPv6 (AF\_INET6)  
  
**socket.SOCK\_STREAM** - defines socket as TCP. SOCK\_DGRAM means socket is UDP protocol.
