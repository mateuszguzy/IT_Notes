  
Grid is a simple layout where we define in which row and column wanted element has to be placed.   
  

```python
canvas.grid(column=1, row=1)
```
  
  
Counting start from 0, and (0, 0) is a top left corner.  
  
When we want to expand a span of a single cell to couple of columns, we use **columnspan** attribute. It defines how many columns should span element starting from defined position.  
  

```python
canvas.grid(column=1, row=1, columnspan=2)
```
