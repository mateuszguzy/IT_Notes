  
Three main layout managers are:  
  
• pack() - places widgets one after another  
• place() - is a precise positioning method which requires an **x** and **y** values. Where .**place(x=0, y=0)** is a top left corner.  
• grid() - allows to divide space into wanted amount of columns and rows and place data in them like **.grid(column=0, row=0)** which are first row and column in a grid. Grid is **relative** to all widgets, so if we have only one widget but we define it in c=5 and r=10, if there are not any other widgets, it will still appear in left top corner  
  
**Grid and Pack methods cannot be mixed!**
