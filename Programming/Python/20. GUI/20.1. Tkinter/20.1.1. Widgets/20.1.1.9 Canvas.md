  
Allows to place items in front of another items, or in a background. Like on canvas.  
  

```python
canvas = Canvas(width=200, height=224)  
tomato\_img = PhotoImage(file='tomato.png')  
canvas.create\_image(100, 112, image=tomato\_img)  
canvas.pack()
```
  
  
**PhotoImage** is a class which holds a file to be used later in code. It's required to use **.create\_image()**, because it cannot load a file from location directly.  
  
After loading and creating an image (with providing it's coordinates) we need to layout it on a screen using any method.  
  
We can also place text:  
  

```python
canvas.create\_text(100, 130, text="00:00", fill='white',font=(FONT\_NAME, 35, 'bold'))  

```
  
  
With providing coordinates, text, and font as a tuple.  
  
To change attribute in canvas we need to use .itemconfig() function, and write one and exact attribute we want to change.  
  

```python
canvas.itemconfig(timer\_text, text=count)
```
