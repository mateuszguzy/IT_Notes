  
**Entry()** Class is responsible for showing user input field. [Docu](https://www.tcl.tk/man/tcl8.4/TkCmd/entry.html) from the original Tk tool, showing what options this Class has.  
  

```python
user\_input = Entry()  
user\_input.pack()  
# to show what value is provided by user use .get() function  
user\_input.get()
```
  
  
When there is wanted to be shown some starting text we need to use **.insert()** function.  
  

```python
user\_input.insert(END, string="Some text to begin with.")
```
  
  
**.insert()** method requires two arguments: index and string.  
Index is a place where to insert the string. If index is set to 0, it will be written at the beginning of the string. There is also built-in **END** variable which means that given text is going to be written after whatever is already written in the text field.
