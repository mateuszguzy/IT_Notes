Here it's method **.after()** in which we specify an amount of miliseconds that window has to wait before doing something  
  

```python
def do\_it():  
    print('Doing something')  
  
window.title("TITLE")  
window.config(padx=50, pady=50)  
window.after(1000, do\_it())
```
  
  
To stop countdown we need to use function **.after\_cancel()** and specify variable name, that previous **.after()** was assigned to.  
  

```python
timer = window.after(1000, do\_it())  
  
window.after\_cancel(timer)
```
