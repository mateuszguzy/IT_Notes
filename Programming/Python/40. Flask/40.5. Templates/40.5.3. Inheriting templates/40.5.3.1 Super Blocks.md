  
When inheriting Classes we often user **super.init()**. That "super" keyword refers to the child that child is inheriting from.   
  
It's used when we want to inherit from the parent but also add something individual in the child.  
  
I.e. we have a styling block in our **base.html**  
  

```python
<style>  
{% block styling %}  
body{  
    background: purple;  
}  
{% endblock %}  
</style>
```
  
  
 It will change background color in all templates that will inherit from it. But if we want to add in one certain child i.e. red font for <h1> tag, we modify it's code like that:  
   

```python
{% block styling %}  
    {‌{ super() }}  
    h1 {  
        color:red;  
    }  
{% endblock %}
```
