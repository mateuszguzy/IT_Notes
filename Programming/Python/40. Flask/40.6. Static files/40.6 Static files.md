  
To use static files i.e. images to render them on site, Flask require folder named **static**. Like in case of HTML templates and **templates** folder.   
  
It's also used for CSS style files. But in case of CSS file we need additional HTML tag  
  

```python
<link rel="stylesheet" href="static/styles.css"
```
   
  
Tho it's possible to target to static file, it's better practice to use dynamic generation with **url\_for** function.   
  

```python
<a href="{{ url\_for('static', filename='styles.css') }}">Link</a>
```
