  
send\_from\_directory(**directory**, **filename**, **path**) - send a file from a given directory with **send\_file()** method. It's a secure way to quickly expose static files from an upload folder.  
  

```python
@app.route('/downloads')  
def download():  
    return send\_from\_directory(directory='static/files', path="cheat\_sheet.pdf")
```
  
  
Above code, shows (if possible) the file in browser window. To only download the file as the attachment a **as\_attachment=True** parameter is needed.  
  
  
We can also determine a general path for uploading files using:  
  

```python
app.config['UPLOAD\_FOLDER'] = 'static/files'  
  
@app.route('/downloads')  
def download():  
    return send\_from\_directory(directory=app.config['UPLOAD\_FOLDER'], path="cheat\_sheet.pdf")
```
