  
Typically debugger in development sever is off. It forces to restart a server with every change committed to the code.   
  
With debugger on, an auto update is made wit every change.  
  
Turning on the debugger:  
  

```python
if \_\_name\_\_ == "\_\_main\_\_":  
	app.run(debug=True)
```
  
  
Debugger shows pin code in console:

It's used in case when we test app in browser, and we want to activate the console directly from browser.   
To avoid unwanted access to our console app, there's a pin code verification.
