First we need to create an admin user  
  

```python
python manage.py createsuperuser
```
  
  
During this process we need to input username of such user, with email address and password.

[Starting a development server](Programming--Python--10._Django--10.2_Development_server.html) we can access an admin page

Right now a Question objects are not editable by admin, to do this we have to adit **polls/admin.py** and add following lines:  
  

```python
from django.contrib import admin  
from .models import Question  
admin.site.register(Question)  

```
  
  
After refreshing the page we see that Questions are now available to edit:

Such admin page can be automatically done, because when creating models we used field types like **CharField** which correspond with HTML input widget.
