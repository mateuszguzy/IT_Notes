  
To call the view, it has to be mapped to the specific URL, for which a URLconf is used.  
  
In current <APP\_NAME> application, no urls.py file is present, so we have to create one, so structure looks like that:  
  
<APP\_NAME>/  
 \_\_init\_\_.py  
 admin.py  
 apps.py  
 migrations/  
 \_\_init\_\_.py  
 models.py  
 tests.py  
 urls.py  
 views.py  
  
This file should contain following code:  
  

```python
from django.urls import path  
  
from . import views # from current directory import file "views"  
  
app\_name = '<APP\_NAME>'  
urlpatterns = [  
	path('', views.index, name='index'),  
]
```
  
  
Right now we have connected "views" file with "index" function to a app urls.  
  
Assigning this script a **app\_name** variable allows further to refer to this particular app, i.e. when using templates and having few apps in one project.  
  
------------------------------  
  
Next step is to link higher: Project urls to app urls.  
  
To do this, a file <SITE\_NAME>/urls.py has to be modified:  
  

```python
from django.contrib import admin  
from django.urls import include, path  
  
urlpatterns = [  
	path('<APP\_NAME>/', include('<APP\_NAME>.urls')),  
	path('admin/', admin.site.urls),  
]
```
  
  
Right now there is link between <SITE\_NAME> **=>** <APP\_NAME> **=>** <APP\_VIEWS>  
  
So, when URL <http://127.0.0.1/<APP_NAME>> is executed it will show whatever is written in app views.  
  
  
  
Used **include()** function allows referencing other URLconfs. When Django encounters **include()**, it divides URL into part that was fit until that point, and the rest of it to the included URLconf for further processing.  
  
**include()** function should be used always, when other URLconfs are used.  
  
  
Used **path()** function has four arguments (**route, view, kwargs, name**) and two are required (**route, view**)  
  
• **route** - is a string contaning URL pattern, i.e. <APP\_NAME>/. When processing a request Django starts at the first pattern in **urlpatterns** and makes its way down the list, comparing requested URL against patters until the right one is found.  
  
 Pattern don't search GET and POST parameters, od the domain name. For example in **http://www.example.com/myapp/,** only **myapp/** will be searched in URLconfs.  
   
• **view** - when Django find a matching pattern it calls the specified function with **HttpRequest** object, as first argument and any “captured” values as a route arguments.   
  
• **kwargs** - additional keyword arguments can be passed in a dictionary to the target view.   
  
• **name** - naming an URL lets to refer to it from elsewhere in Django, especially from within templates. This allows to make global changes to the URL patterns of project while only modifying one file.   
  
  
We can also prepare dynamic views which will be flexible depending on user input i.e. provided index  
  

```python
urlpatterns = [  
    path('', views.index, name='index'),  
    # ex: /<APP\_NAME>/1/  
    path('<int:question\_id>/', views.detail, name='detail'),  
    # ex: /<APP\_NAME>/1/results  
    path('<int:question\_id>/results/', views.results, name='results'),  
    # ex: /<APP\_NAME>/1/vote  
    path('<int:question\_id>/vote/', views.vote, name='vote')  
]
```
  
  
Providing example url **/polls/1** Django will go through **mysite.urls** where path to **/polls/** is provided:  
  
![images/1025-1.png](images/1025-1.png)  
  
then request is stripped from **/polls/** and Django continues search in given directory for rest of the request. It will search inside **polls.urls.py** where will find out **‘<int:question\_id>/'**.  
  
The **:question\_id>** part of the string defines the name that will be used identify the matched pattern and **<int:** part determines what patterns should match this part of the URL path.
