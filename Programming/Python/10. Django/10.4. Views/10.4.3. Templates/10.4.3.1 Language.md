That's why Django template language provides some programming constructs like **if** or **for**, but they are not executed as Python code, and template system will not run arbitrary Python expressions.   
  
[More](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/ref/templates/language/) on template syntax.  
  
Django template language involves four constructs:  
  
1. **Tags**  
  
Tags provide arbitrary logic. It can i.e. output content, control structure with **if** or **for** loop, or enable access to other template tags.  
  
Tag syntax:  
  
{% %}  
  
Some tags like i.e. if loop require open and close tag:  
  
{% if %}  
{% endif %}  
  
2. **Variables**  
  
A variable takes value from the **context** (a dict-like object which mapps keys to values).   
  
With context like:  
  
context = {'first\_name': ‘John’, ‘last\_name': ‘Doe’}  
  
variable will look like:  
  
My first name is **{{first\_name}}**, and my last name is **{{last\_name}}**  
  
Dictionary, attribute and list-index lookups are implemented with a dot notation:  
  
{{my\_dictionary.key }}  
   
3. **Filters**  
  
They transform the values of variables and tag arguments.   
  
Syntax:  
  
{{ django | title }}  
  
When applied filter:  
  
{'django' : ‘abc def lmno xyz’}  
  
renders:  
  
‘Abc Def Lmno Xyz’
