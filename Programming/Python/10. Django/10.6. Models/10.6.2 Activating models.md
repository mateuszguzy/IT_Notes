But before that we need to link app to a project editing **<PROJECT\_NAME>/settings.py**  
  
It's done by adding path into **INSTALLED\_APPS**, looking like:  
  
 **<APP\_NAME>.apps.<APP\_NAME>Config**  
  
Example:  
  
 **polls.apps.PollsConfig**  
  
Configuration class (PollsConfig in this case) is placed in app localization in **apps.py** file, that's why dotted path looks like this.  
  
Next thing is letting Django know that some changes has been made in models, it's done by **makemigrations** command.  
  

```python
python manage.py makemigrations <APP\_NAME>
```
  
  
And successful output looks like:

Migrations are changes made to models that are stored by Django, they are files on disk.  
  
Next step is to let Django know which migration to put into a database with use of **sqlmigrate** command.  
  

```python
python manage.py sqlmigrate polls 0001
```
  
  
And output looks like:  
  
![images/1031-2.png](images/1031-2.png)  
  
By default table names are created from <APP\_NAME> \_ <MODEL\_NAME>  
  
Primary keys (IDs) are added by default.  
  
Also by default Django appends “ **\_id** ” to the foreign key field name.  
  
Above can be override by user.   
  
**sqlmigrate** command doesn't run the migration, it only prints it to the screen for check, of what SQL is going to be used to create DB. It can be verified by user.  
  
To check if there are any problems with project without making migration a **check** command is used:  
  

```python
python manage.py check
```
  
  
To finally make migration to SQL type command:  
  

```python
python manage.py migrate
```

It takes all migration that haven't been applied (Django tracks which ones are applied, using special table in DB called **django\_migrations**, and checks each time what need to be migrated)  
  
MIgrations let change models over development of the project without the need to delete database or tables to make new ones. It specializes in upgrading database live without data loss.  
  
Upgrade schema:  
  
1. Change model  
2. Run **python manage.py makemigrations** to create migrations for those changes  
3. Run **python manage.py migrate** to apply changes  
  
Reason for two commands to update data is that migrations are committed to version control systems and shipped with an app.
