  
To start an interactive python shell type:  
  
python manage.py shell  
  
We are using “manage.py" because it allows python to import path to **mysite/settings.py** file.  
  
Now we can i.e. add Question to a poll:  
  
First we check if there are any questions. then we want the publication date to be as precise as it could so we import timezone library which is included in Django.  
  
Creating new Question we follow the schema prepared earlier. and save when question is done. It now has a ID and we can invoke it from the terminal.

Right now <Question: Question object (1)> is not very helpful representation of question. Let's add a \_\_str\_\_() method to both Question in Choice from **polls/models.py**

When “self” method is added it changes method Question is print, by showing it's question\_text instead of ID.

API also allows to filter objects by different criteria i.e.: id, \_\_startswith, \_\_year, pk (primary key))

![images/1126-5.png](images/1126-5.png)  
  
Right now we can create some choices for those questions using **create()** call. It creates a new Choice object, does the **INSERT** statement, adds the choice to the set of available choices and return a new Choice object.   
  
Django creates a set to held the “other side” of the Foreign Key relation (question's choice) which can be accessed via the API

We can also assign a variable to choice and invoke it's question, or count possible choices.

We can also filter choices as they are objects like Questions, even by few relationships at a time using double underscore to separate them:  
  
![images/1126-9.png](images/1126-9.png)  
  
Where **current\_year** is created variable:

We can also delete choices with **delete()** call
