  
Why Python:  
  
• fast development - allows faster coding due to readability and ease of use  
• clear and simple syntax (similar to english language) - faster code review   
• multitude of frameworks and libraries for different applications  
• extensive support of free guides and tutorials  
• flexible and scalable  
• finds application in:  
 ◇ IoT  
 ◇ Machine Learning  
 ◇ Data Science  
 ◇ Web development  
  
Cons of Python:  
  
• in Data Science - slower search for data errors due to dynamic typing  
• limited CPU speed (it can be avoided by combining Python with i.e. C using **Cython**)
