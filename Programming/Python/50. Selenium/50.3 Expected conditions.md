It's helpful with dynamic loading of elements, like:  
  
• **buttons** - visible, but not clickable  
• **labels** - present in DOM, but certain text is expected to be present in the element  
  
There are two main types of Expected Conditions.  
  
**1. ExpectedCondition <WebElement>**  
  
Has a locator as a parameter. An explicit wait can be applied to the condition that tries to find the web element in question.  
If the condition finds element, it returns it as a result.  
  
**2. ExpectedCondition <Boolean>**  
  
Has a string parameter. The wait command applies the condition to the parameter. Returns True of False.  
  
  
There is a list of all ExpectedCondition available [here](https://www.selenium.dev/selenium/docs/api/py/webdriver_support/selenium.webdriver.support.expected_conditions.html).  
  
Expected conditions are often combined with WebDriverWait function, which allows WebDriver to wait certain amount of time, to meet the condition, if not, error is returned.  
  
  

```python
# necessary imports  
from selenium.webdriver.common.by import By  
from selenium.webdriver.support import expected\_conditions as ec  
from selenium.webdriver.support.ui import WebDriverWait  
  
# specified webdriver Object, and time in seconds to wait until next function is fullfilled  
WebDriverWait(self.driver, 10).until(ec.visibility\_of\_element\_located((By.TAG\_NAME, "input")))
```
