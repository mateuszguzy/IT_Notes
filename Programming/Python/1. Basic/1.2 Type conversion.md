1. Numbers  
  

```python
i=10  
type(i)   
# <class'int'>  
f=float(i)  
# f=10.0
```
  
  
2. Strings  
  

```python
s='123'  
print(type(s))  
# <class'str'>  
i=int(s)  
print(type(i))  
# <class'int'>
```
  
  
3. F-Strings  
  
When concatenating str with other data types we can use F-String to avoid type conversion.  
All it takes is to place an “f” before quotes, and put non-sting variables into curly braces.   
  

```python
count = 0  
boolean = True  
  
print(f"Is count equal to {count}? {boolean}")
```
  
  
4. Ordinals of character  
  
This functions returns a numerical value of ASCII characters, because every character is represented by numbers 0-255. It's helpful during sorting, because that's the basis on which characters are sorted.  
  

```python
print(ord('H'))  
  
------------------------------  
72
```
  
  
Reverse of this function is a **chr()** function  
  

```python
print(chr(66))  
  
------------------------------  
B
```
