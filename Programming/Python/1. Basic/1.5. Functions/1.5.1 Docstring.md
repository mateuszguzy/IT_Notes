  
Docstrings are documentation notes about the function. They can be added to any function defined in code by adding description in triple quote on first line in function definition. It allows to write on many lines like it is one line. Opposite to normal string definition.  
  

```python
def clear():  
 """Clears console"""  
    os.system("clear")
```
