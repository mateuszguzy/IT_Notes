  
When we are not sure how many arguments will be provided in function, or don't want to make it stiff, we can use **unlimited arguments**.  
  

```python
def function(\*args):  
	for n in args:  
 print(n)  
function(5, 1)  
------------------------------  
  
5  
1
```
  
  
The “args” is a default name and can be changed, but if we want to put many arguments we HAVE to use asterix “\*”. All "args" are going to be formed as a tuple.  
  
We can also access every arguments by it's position - they are in tuple.  
  

```python
def function(\*args):  
 print(args[1])  
function(5, 1)  
------------------------------  
1
```
