```python
import functools  
  
l = [1, 2, 3]  
x = functools.reduce(lambda a, b: a + b, l)  
print(x)

In this example we get sum of list elements.  
  
Function works like:  
  
• first two elements of sequence are picked and passed through function  
• next result of previous function is first of the arguments, and the second one is another element from the sequence  
• process goes until there are no more elements left in sequence  
• only final result is returned  
  
Function is similar to [accumulate](Programming--Python--1._Basic--1.5_Functions--99._Useful_functions--2._Itertools--2.1_Accumulate.html) function.
