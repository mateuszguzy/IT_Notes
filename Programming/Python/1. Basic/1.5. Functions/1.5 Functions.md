First iteration of function (after “ **def** ”) is a “ storage place " where function is written but it doesn't run. Only invoking previously written function later in code run the lines.  
  
Python functions are **First-class Objects** which mean that they can be assigned to variables, passed as result of other functions or passes as an argument.  
  

```python
def sayHello():  
 print('Hello')  
print('Good morning')  
sayHello()
```
  
  
Functions also can work on arguments, pieces of data code will work on and show the return value. It's stored in parentheses after function name. Arguments are new every time a function is invoked again, so every instance of function can work in different way.  
  

```python
def newFunc('argument'):  
	code  
	code
```

Parameters are variables which are used **IN** the function definition. It allows function to access arguments for a particular function invocation. i.e.:  
  

```python
def greet(lang):  
 if lang == 'es':  
 print('Hola')  
 elif lang == 'fr':  
 print('Bonjour')  
 else:  
 print('Hello')  
  
greet('en')		#returns "Hello"
```
  
  
Using “ **return** ” keyword tells function to end it's work, and not run code after that. It can have assigned “ **return value** ”.  
  

```python
def greet():  
 return ('Hello')  
  
print (greet(), "Benny")
```
