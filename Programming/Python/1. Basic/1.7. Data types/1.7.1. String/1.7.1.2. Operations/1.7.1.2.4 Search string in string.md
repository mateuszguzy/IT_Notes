  
Using “ **in** " operator, we can check if given string contains required string.  
  

```python
fruit = 'banana'  
if 'b' in fruit:  
 print('true')
```
  
  
Also function **find()** can be used to determine first appearance of searched string. If there isn't any instance return value is “ 0 ”. Find can have declared search starting position which is a second argument in parenthesis (<searched>, <start\_from>  
  

```python
fruit="banana"  
pos=fruit.find('na')  
print(pos)		#returns "2"
```
