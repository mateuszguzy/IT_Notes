  
Python allows option to not modify string with every change, and keep order in variables, by placing them at the end of a string.   
  
It also allows to designate specific type like %s for string or %d for digit.  
  

```python
"Auction winner is: %s, with value of: $%s" % (higher\_bidder, higher\_bid)
```
