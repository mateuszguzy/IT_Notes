Dictionaries on contrary to lists, don't have order, they are just containing easy to acquire data with help of “ **lookup tags** ” which are value name.  
  

```python
new=dict()  
new['1']='one'  
new['2']='two'  
print(new)  
  
------------------------------  
{'1': 'one', '2': 'two'}
```
  
  
It's an error to refer to a key which is not present in dictionary, that's why a “ in " operator is used to first check if the tag is present.k
