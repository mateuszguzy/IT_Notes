Tuples are more efficient comparing to lists. There is no memory taken for modifications so the performance is better.   
  
They are often used as “temporary variables”.  
  

```python
x=('A','B','C')  
print(x[0])  
print(max(x)  
print(x)  
  
------------------------------  
A  
C  
('A', 'B', 'C')
```
  
  
Tuples can be put on left side of equation, even without use of parenthesis. They are used instead of making multiple assigning lines.  
  

```python
(x,y)=(1,2)  
A, B=('a','b')  
print(x, A)  
  
------------------------------  
(1, 'a')
```
