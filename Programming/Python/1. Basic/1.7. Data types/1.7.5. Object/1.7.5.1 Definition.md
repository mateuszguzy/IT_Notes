Beautiful Soup can be treated like an object, we don't need to know, how everything works inside an object, we just need to know how to communicate with is, and operate it.  
  
Object **class** is a template we are using to create more objects. I.e. Dog can be a class and separate breeds are objects made with use of this class.  
  
Objects contain **method/message** which is a function working inside that object (i.e. bark() for Dog class), and **field/attribute** which is a data in the class (variables i.e. color for Dog class).  
  
Example of an object:  
  

```python
class Party:  
#this is an attribute  
	x=0  
#this is a method  
	def members(self):  
 self.x=self.x+1  
 print('So far: ', self.x)  
  
#this is creating new Object using Party class  
Party().members()  
Party().members()  
  
------------------------------  
So far: 1  
So far: 2
```
  
  
**self** within a class refers to class itself, because every object can be created with different name i.e. WildParty = Party() with attribute x=100, if members function would refer to Party, object WildParty would not have working members function. That's why **self** keyword is used, so every instance refers to itself.
