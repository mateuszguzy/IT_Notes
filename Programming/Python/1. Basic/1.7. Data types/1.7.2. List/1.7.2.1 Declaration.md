  
Collections in Python are like arrays in JS, it's one variable containing multiple data. One of these collections are called **LISTS**. Lists can contain other lists. Lists are **mutable**.  
  
Example;  
  

```python
friends = ['Jerry','Sally','Bob']  
friends[0]='Fred'  
print(friends)  
  
------------------------------  
['Fred', 'Sally', 'Bob']
```
  
  
Lists like strings has indexes, starting from " 0 ".
