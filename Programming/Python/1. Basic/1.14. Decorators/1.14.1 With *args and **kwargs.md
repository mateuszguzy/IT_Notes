In below scenario there's “User” class defined with attribute “is logged in” that need to be checked i.e. when creating a blog post but also in commenting, changing user setting etc.  
  
So every time the decorator is used over such function it goes with different function argument (in case of blog post it's “user” argument).  
  
To avoid troubles with wrongly declared arguments we can use **\*args** and **\*\*kwargs**. So that we always respond to first argument provided in function which in this case will be “user” argument. Also we can pass **arg** and **kwarg** into checked function **(1)**.  
  
  

```python
class User:  
    def \_\_init\_\_(self, name):  
        self.name = name  
        self.is\_logged\_in = False  
  
def is\_authenticated\_decorator(function):  
    def wrapper(\*args, \*\*kwargs):  
        if args[0].is\_logged\_in == True:  
        	# (1)  
            function(args[0])  
    return wrapper  
  
@is\_authenticated\_decorator  
def create\_blog\_post(user):  
    print(f"This is {user.name}'s new blog post.")
```
