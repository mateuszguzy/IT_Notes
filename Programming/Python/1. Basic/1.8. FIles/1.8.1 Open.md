  
**open(filename, mode)** - is a function used to opening files in python. It return a “ **file handle** ” which is a variable used to perform operations on the file. Mode is optional and should be “ **r** ” if we are planning to read the file, and “ **w** ” if we are going to write to the file.  
  
Python is using **handle** as a gateway to file. Simply opening file and printing it, doesn't give content of the file, but just information kept in handle.  
  

```python
fhandle=open('text.txt')  
print(fhandle)  
fhandle.close()  
  
------------------------------  
<open file '/tmp/text.txt', mode 'r' at 0x7f5267590ae0>
```

After working with file it **ALWAYS** has to be closed. Although to not remember it every time we can use “with” keyword:  
  

```python
with open('text.txt') as file:  
 print(file.read())
```
  
  
It manages a opened file and closes it as soon as we're done working on it.
