  
To modify a file we need to open it with a special “mode”.  
  
For files we want to overwrite:  
  

```python
with open('text.txt', mode='w') as file:  
	file.write('new words')
```
  
  
For files we want to append new data to:  
  

```python
with open('text.txt', mode='a') as file:  
	file.write('new words')
```
  
  
By default a mode is ‘r’ - read only  
  
When we open a file in a write mode, but it doesn't exist, the file is going to be **CREATED**.
