  
There is a library in Python called “CSV” to help working with Comma Separated Values.  
It takes each row and makes a list out of it converting everything into string type.  
  

```python
import csv  
  
with open('weather\_data.csv') as file:  
    data = csv.reader(file)  
    for row in file:  
        print(row)  
------------------------------  
  
day,temp,condition  
Monday,12,Sunny  
Tuesday,14,Rain  
Wednesday,15,Rain  
Thursday,14,Cloudy  
Friday,21,Sunny  
Saturday,22,Sunny  
Sunday,24,Sunny
```
  
  
For better handling of CSV files and performing operations on them “[Pandas](Programming--Python--1._Basic--1.8_Files--1.8.4_CSV_Files--1.8.4.1_Pandas.html)” library is better.
