  
Keys are special columns by which we make references between tables in scope of one database. Most common key column name is “ **ID** ”.  
  
There are three kinds of keys:  
  
• **primary key** - usually it's an integer auto-increment field   
• **logical key** - what users are using for lookup   
• **foreign key** - integer key pointing to a row in another table  
 Example:

 **DO NOT** use logical keys, as primary keys. Logical keys are entries inside DB and might be changed.   
  
Relationships in DB based on matching string fields are less efficient than integers.
