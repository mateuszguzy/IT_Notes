DISTINCT is heavy on DB because it has to look through every record to check fro doubles. In case of bigger DBs it's better to filter it through script.  
  

```python
SELECT  
    country  
FROM customer\_list ORDER BY country ASC;
```

As we can see there are a lot of same results.  
  

```python
SELECT  
    DISTINCT country  
FROM customer\_list ORDER BY country ASC;
```

After using DISTINCT there are only unique values in results.  
  
Command relates to all the columns stated in SELECT query, so in that case we can see that Angola is shown twice, but result PAIR: COUNTRY - CITY is always unique.  
  

```python
SELECT  
    DISTINCT country, city  
FROM customer\_list ORDER BY country ASC;  
  

```
